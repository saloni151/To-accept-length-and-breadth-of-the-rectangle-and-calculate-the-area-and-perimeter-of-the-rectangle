**Problem Statement: Write a Python program that will accept length and breadth of the rectangle and calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.**

# Rectangle Area and Perimeter Calculator 

This is a simple Python program that calculates the **Area** and **Perimeter** of a rectangle based on user input for **length** and **breadth**.

##  Formula Used

- **Area** = Length × Breadth  
- **Perimeter** = 2 × (Length + Breadth)
